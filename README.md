**CTF Challenges** for competitions and workshops organized as part of a training project aimed at developing cybersecurity skills among high school students. This initiative is conducted under the Digital Community for the 21st Century Society project and the Rajabhat University for Local Development program, held at Khuangnaipittayakan School, Khueang Nai District, Ubon Ratchathani Province. The project is conducted by instructors from the Faculty of Computer Science, Ubon Ratchathani Rajabhat University.

We use CTFd as the CTF framework and Docker to run various services. The setup includes containers for CTFd, APT-Cacher NG, Nginx, and various challenge services that require server-side components. All of these are combined into a Docker Compose setup located in the `server` directory. To run the system, it is recommended to use `./start.sh` or alternatively build the necessary images first before running Docker Compose.
