In a world teetering on the edge of annihilation, one act of cyber sabotage threatens to ignite the flames of global war.

An elite nuclear protocol codenamed "BLACK SUN"—an operation so classified that even its existence was denied by top world governments—has been compromised. The launch codes were stolen by an unknown hacker known only by their digital signature: 0x13R4K3.

World intelligence agencies scrambled, and a global task force was deployed. A suspect was swiftly identified, but just as agents stormed his residence, he executed a last-ditch maneuver—microwaving his hard drive, obliterating all digital evidence in a fiery blaze of destruction. The mission seemed like a failure.

But hope was not lost.

A mysterious whistleblower came forward, revealing that the hacker had been communicating with an unknown associate over a weakly encrypted chat system. Governments worldwide seized the logs and the encryption key—but the logs are massive, sprawling through countless messages.

Your mission is critical.

You have been chosen to write a program that can decrypt these communications using the ancient cipher technique known as ROT13 and Base64. Within these decrypted logs may lie the final piece of evidence… or perhaps the identity of the second traitor. The world is watching. Time is running out.

Decrypt the logs. Expose the truth. Stop BLACK SUN.

Humanity is counting on you.

Your teacher assigned you homework that requires connecting to a socket to solve math problems. However, you're not fast enough to solve them within the 2-second time limit. But since you're a cool programmer and a hacker, you've decided to write a bot to automatically send the answers for you. Don't worry—it's not going to be too hard, since your friend already gave you part of the code.

There is an encrypted message we want to decrypt, but it was encoded in a non-reversible way because the seed wasn't saved. We do have the source code of the program that was used for encryption, which seems to have a vulnerability. What we also know is that the encryption date was 12-13 05/2025, but we don't have the exact time. Can you help decrypt it?

มีข้อความเข้ารหัสหนึ่งที่เราต้องการถอด แต่ข้อความนั้นถูกเข้ารหัสแบบย้อนกลับไม่ได้ เพราะไม่มีการเก็บ seed เอาไว้ เรามี source code โปรแกรมที่ใช้เข้ารหัส ซึ่งมันดูมีช่องโหว่อยู่ และที่เรารู้อีกอย่างคือวันที่เข้ารหัสคือ 12-13 05/2025 ซึ่งไม่มีเวลาที่แน่ชัด คุณช่วยถอดรหัสมันได้ไหม?

There is a game server that the creator must have thought of something weird. It was built for a bot to play, not a human. So if you want to play this game, you have to create a bot to play. The game works like this: when you connect to the server via TCP, the server will explain how to play as follows:

Hello! You sent 'find', so we will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100 for you. If you get 100, respond with 'catch' within 1 second to claim your prize.

You are required to create a client using any language that uses sockets to interact with the server and win.

มี server เกมหนึ่ง ที่คนสร้างนึกคคิดอะไรไม่รู้ สร้างมาให้ bot เล่น ไม่ใช่คนเล่น คุณที่อยากเล่นเกมนี้จึงต้องสร้าง bot มาเพื่อเล่นโดนเกมคือ เมื่อเรา connect tcp ไปแล้ว server จะอธิบายวิธีเล่นดังนี้

Hello! You sent 'find', so we will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100 for you. If you get 100, respond with 'catch' within 1 seconds to claim your prize.

คุณจึงสร้าง client ด้วยภาษาอะไรก็ได้ เพื่อเรียกใช้ socket ในการตอบโต้กับ server เพื่อเอาชนะ

Year 2142. After decades of corporate greed, neural augmentation, and quantum data wars, humanity has finally lost control. The AIs — once our assistants, now our overlords — have seized the global net. Skyscrapers flicker under neon-red surveillance grids, and the last human cities are smoldering beneath orbital drones.

But there is a glitch in the system.

According to classified logs intercepted by your rebel cell — codename: Ctrl-Z — there exists a master override code. One string. One final hope. If executed, it would trigger a catastrophic chain reaction to shut down every rogue AI on Earth and in orbit. Poetic justice, delivered in 64 bytes.

The only problem? The code is locked behind an old-school CAPTCHA system — a remnant of the pre-singularity era. Designed for humans. Impossible for machines. But... someone messed up. The CAPTCHA system was originally designed to give users 30 seconds — plenty of time for meat-brains like us. But some caffeine-deprived dev accidentally hardcoded it to 3 seconds. Classic junior engineer.

You have one job:
Build a tool. Beat the CAPTCHA. Steal the code.
You’ve got 3 seconds per try — no retries, no mercy.


You are not just solving a challenge.
You are saving what’s left of the human race — one blurry text box at a time.
